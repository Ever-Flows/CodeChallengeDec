Exercise 1

1. Two python scripts - retrieve.py - retreives data from API and stores in database fiel provided 
2. python script - table2
3. Comments in file - But to make the scripts more robust - update for environments, shutdowns, partial runs and less than 10 days forecast, also change database to hold more data if needed
4. For expectations - will make sure that the data is all that is needed and if next 10 days n
eed to be stored for every pull. Also look at data retention and adjust script accordingly. Wind chill and Wind speed are not available as forecasts - so will confirm that - probably move to another API
